# Quick start

It is recommended to install `docsify-cli` globally, which helps initializing and previewing the website locally.

```bash
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

## Preview your site

Run the local server with `docsify serve`. You can preview your site in your browser on `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
docsify serve docs --open
```

> For more use cases of `docsify-cli`, head over to the [docsify-cli documentation](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify-cli).

## Writing content

You can see the file list in the `./docs` subdirectory.

- `index.html` as the entry file
- `README.md` as the home page
- `.nojekyll` prevents GitHub Pages from ignoring files that begin with an underscore

You can easily update the documentation in `./docs/README.md`, of course you can add [more pages](more-pages.md).
